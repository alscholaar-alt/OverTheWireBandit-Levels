## Level 16-17

***Aim:*** Find the credentials for the next level by submitting the password if the previous level to a port on localhost that has the following properties:

- port number: between 31000 and 32000
- a port that has a server listening on it
- find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t
- There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

`nmap` is a network mapper and can be used as a port scanner.

I used `nmap` to search for ports between 31000 and 32000 that were open, this also means that it has a server listening on it and it displayed 5 different ports.

```bash
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

It printed

```bash
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown
```
