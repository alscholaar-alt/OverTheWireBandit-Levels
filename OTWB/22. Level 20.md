***Aim:*** Use the setuid program in the home directory to connect to a local port, send the previous level’s password, and receive the password for the next level if it is correct.

***Action taken:*** 
- ran the `ls` command
- ran the `./` command to execute the `bandit20-do` binary

```bash
./bandit20-do
```

it printed 

```bash
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do whoami
