## Level 18-19

***Aim:*** Access the home directory to read the readme file containing the next password, despite an altered .bashrc that forces an immediate logout on SSH login.

***Action taken:*** 
- ran the usual ssh command to try to log into level 18

I kept getting logged out but learnt that you can run a command in the server without entering the server by adding the command in quotation marks at the end of the command line

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
```

***Level 19 Password:*** `cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8`
