## Level 8-9
***Aim:*** Find the password on a file called data.txt on the only line of text that occurs once

***Action taken:***
- I used the `ls` command to list the files in the home directory
- After seeing that data.txt was available, i ran the `sort` command to list the text of the file in alphabetical order
```bash
sort data.txt
```
- i skimmed through and found that the only line that wasn't repeated was `4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM`
- To get a cleaner look i used the pipe operator and added in the `uniq -u` command to only print unique lines
```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```
It printed `4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM`
