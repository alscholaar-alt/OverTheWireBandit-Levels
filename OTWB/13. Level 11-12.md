## Level 11 - 12
***Aim:*** Find the password from ffile data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

The helpful reading material went through ROT13 which explained the aim, now we needed to translate that into a command

***Action taken:*** 
- used the `ls` command to list the contents
- Seen that the `data.txt` file was in the current working directory
- used the `cat data.txt` command to show the conents of the file
- the file printed `
- It was clear that this is the part that needed to be translated, so i ran the cat command followed by the tr command

```bash
base64 -d data.txt
```
