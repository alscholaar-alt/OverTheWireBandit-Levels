## Level 12 - 13

***Aim:*** Extract the password for the next level from data.txt, which contains a repeatedly compressed hexdump, by working in a temporary directory under /tmp


Note: 

-I read the helpful reading material on hexdump to help me through this level 
- there were many repeated steps, I'll list them towards the end

***Action taken:***
- used the `ls` command to list the contents
- Seen that the `data.txt` file was in the current working directory
- used the `cat data.txt` command to show the conents of the file
- the file showed many Hexidecimals, so I knew that I needed to decode this and 
- It was clear that this is the part that needed to be translated, so i ran the cat command followed by the tr command

```bash
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```
