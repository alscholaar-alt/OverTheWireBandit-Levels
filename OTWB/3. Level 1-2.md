## Level 1 - 2
***Aim:*** Finding the password from a file named "-"

***Action taken:*** 
- used the `ls` command to list the contents
- the `-` file was present
- After not being able to list the content using the `cat -` command as it is read from a stdin not a file
- I learnt that `./-` forces the shell to read `-` as a file in the current directory
- used the `cat ./-` command to list the contents in that file

```bash
cat ./-
```
***Level 2 password:*** `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx`
